SpriteGenerator

No this has nothing to do with css sprites, rather the sprites you see in 2D games
Trying to make the stuff here generic, so I can use them inside Project RPG, and Project Elysium

TODO:

- panel to draw the sprite square by square
- store the sprite in a compressed notation
- make UI for controlling the drawing
	- add color picker
	- change the amount of grid squares it uses
	- delete colored squares
	- show preview of sprite in different sizes
	- toggle between showing the grid and nt
- scale the sprite
- give frames to the sprite to make it look like it is animating
	- add a new UI to make transitions easy to create

BIG TODO:
- make sprite generation API

- decide what to do next
